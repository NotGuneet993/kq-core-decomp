This is my implementation of the code from the research paper "(k,q)-core decomposition of hypergraphs"
link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06712#:~:text=In%20this%20study%2C%20first%2C%20we,contains%20at%20least%20q%20vertices.

The data used is the Enron email hypergraph dataset.

In the dataset I have not used the "core-email-Enron.txt" file since the mapping is in another file
